# Deploying and Editing Locally

Clone the repository, ensure the github repository is configured for github pages and that it's building from the master branch

## Prerequisites

* jekyll

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# Project Structure
The project is broken down into three key content structures, allowing product, tech and content to own and manage their own sections of the website.

`Content`, `Documentation` and `Product` are both folders and application collections that will update when new files are added following the page template requirements

![dev.knewton content structure](./resources/readme/content-structure.gif)

## Page Structure
Each page within these three collections must adhere to the template page structure defined below, updated with the detailed relevant to your new page.

```
---
layout: 'documentation-single'
title: Learner Analytics
description: 
keywords: 
order: 0

hero:
    title: Analytics
    text: Learner Analytics
---

Your markdown / page content lives here
```

**NOTE:** See the preview template page at /template for a full example

The page title and descriptions are included in not just the HTML title / description metas, but also in the page preview text on the content index pages. 

## Layout Alternatives
Each page must specify which template should be applied in the header `layout` variable, these layout variables are limited to:

* `documentation-single`
* `product-single`
* `content-single`

## Promoting a page
A page within a colleciton can be promoted to the primary CTA for the collection by specifying an order of -1. Only one page *should* be promoted at one time per collection.

# Editing Content
All content is editable following the markdown syntax (https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

## Editing existing content
