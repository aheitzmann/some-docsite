# Deploying and Editing locally

In your clone or fork, ensure the github repository is configured for github pages, and that it's configured to build from the master branch.

## Prerequisites

* ruby
* jekyll

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## _config.yml
`_config.yml` contains all of the basic properties for managing an instance of the site, including complete nav / footer link customisations.

**NOTE:** If you make any changes to the properties or values in `_config.yml` you must restart the terminal.

Ensure you edit the following base url and google analytics values:

```
knewton:
    baseurl: /some-sub-domain
    google_analytics:
        tracking_code: x
```

# Project Structure
The project is broken down into three key content structures (jekyll collections).

`Content`, `Documentation` and `Product` are both folders and application collections that will update when new files are added following the page template requirements

![dev.knewton content structure](./resources/readme/content-structure.gif)

## Page Structure
Each page within these three collections must adhere to the template page structure defined below, updated with the detailed relevant to your new page.

```
---
layout: 'documentation-single'
title: Learner Analytics
description: 
keywords: 
order: 0

hero:
    title: Analytics
    text: Learner Analytics
---

Your markdown / page content lives here
```

**NOTE:** See the preview template page at /template for a full example

The page title and descriptions are included in not just the HTML title / description metas, but also in the page preview text on the content index pages. 

## Layout Alternatives
Each page must specify which template should be applied in the header `layout` variable, these layout variables are limited to:

* `documentation-single`
* `product-single`
* `content-single`

## Promoting a page
A page within a colleciton can be promoted to the primary CTA for the collection by specifying an order of `-1`. Only one page *should* be promoted at one time per collection.

## The Template Page
In the root directory exists a markdown file called `template.md`. This page takes advantage of the `documentation-single` layout to provide a basic demo / template page to make starting new documentation pages easier. This template also includes markdown basics like titles, images, tables, code, lines etc

You can view the compiled template page by navigating to `/template`

# Editing Content
All content is editable following the markdown syntax (https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

## Editing existing content
You can quickly edit existing content by using the github ui and commiting changes back. These changes will be automatically collected by github and the content re-generated in almost real time.

## Adding new content

You can navigate to the colleciton you want to add a new page to and add the content directly into github.
