      title: How Knewton Works
      description: The Knewton platform is accessed through the flexible Knewton API, and is built to power an array of features within existing or new digital education products. Partners can harness the Knewton API to create continuously adaptive learning experiences. A learner-facing product sends learner interaction and performance data to Knewton, then receives personalized recommendations and analytics via the Knewton API.
      terminator: Knewton technology works across nearly any subject area or learner demographic. Partners connect the lessons, homework, and assessments in their applications to the Knewton platform in order to deliver uniquely personalized and accelerated learning experiences that continuously adapt to each learner. Knewton matches learners with the optimal lesson, question, explanation, or activity — exactly when they need it. Knewton’s data scientists, software engineers, product managers, adaptive instruction analysts, implementation architects, and other team members have devoted their careers to helping instructors differentiate instruction more effectively, making the underlying technology scalable, and ensuring the platform continues to serve learners, instructors, and publishers as the technological landscape around it improves and changes.
